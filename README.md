# TBAPi

TBAPi is a time based alarm scheduler for use in boarding houses. It includes a web interface and a client (see [tbapi-scheduler](https://github.com/robthr/tbapi-client)).

## Try it Now!

    git clone https://github.com/robthr/tbapi
    cd tbapi
    npm i
    node start

This starts the web server on port 3000. The [.env.example](https://github.com/robthr/tbapi/blob/master/.env.example) file needs to be populated for the server to run.

## TODO

-   [ ] Better database deletion methods
-   [ ] Better sound management (maybe another collection)
-   [ ] Fade in flash messages with jQuery
